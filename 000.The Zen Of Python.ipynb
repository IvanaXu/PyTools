    "•明了胜于晦涩(优美的代码应当是明了的，命名规范，风格相似)\n",
    "•简洁胜于复杂(优美的代码应当是简洁的，不要有复杂的内部实现)\n",
    "•复杂胜于凌乱(如果复杂不可避免，那代码间也不能有难懂的关系，要保持接口简洁)\n",
    "•扁平胜于嵌套(优美的代码应当是扁平的，不能有太多的嵌套)\n",
    "•间隔胜于紧凑(优美的代码有适当的间隔，不要奢望一行代码解决问题)\n",
    "•可读性很重要(优美的代码是可读的)\n",
    "•即便假借特例的实用性之名，也不可违背这些规则(这些规则至高无上)\n",
    "•不要包容所有错误，除非你确定需要这样做(精准地捕获异常，不写 except:pass 风格的代码)\n",
    "•当存在多种可能，不要尝试去猜测\n",
    "•而是尽量找一种，最好是唯一一种明显的解决方案(如果不确定，就用穷举法)\n",
    "•虽然这并不容易，因为你不是 Python 之父(这里的 Dutch 是指 Guido )\n",
    "•做也许好过不做，但不假思索就动手还不如不做(动手之前要细思量)\n",
    "•如果你无法向人描述你的方案，那肯定不是一个好方案；反之亦然(方案测评标准)\n",
    "•命名空间是一种绝妙的理念，我们应当多加利用(倡导与号召)\n",
